<h1>The Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>aka Indi's Favorite Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>Makes me cry everytime at the end. Love the messages in it, between the mother/daughter/family dynamic and just feeling unaccomplished in life
<br>
Like the grass is greener on the other side.
</p>
<h3>Black Panther 1 + 2</h3>
<p>Both movies are near and dear to my heart, especially the second after Chadwick's passing.
    <br>
First movie was so important and amazing for black people like myself. We got to see ourselves as heroes and villains, dynamic not static. I cried.
<br>
Second movie was beautiful tribute to Chadwick and even expanded on what the first movie couldn't/didn't in terms of themes + the theme of grief and acceptance.
<br>
I also cried.</p>
<h3>Any Studio Ghibli film</h3>
<p>Honestly enough said. It's Studio Ghibli (minus Tales from Earthsea) and those movies are peak.
    <br>
Will absolutely watch again, maybe even tonight or this weekend :D
</p>
<h3>Earth to Echo</h3>
<p>Grew up with this movie, watched it as a kid. I honestly couldn't think of a third movie, but this one came to mind for some reason.
    <br>
I remember wanting a friend group like the one in the movie, and wanting something like that to happen to me. It was a fun movie (to me) to watch.
<br>
And of course, I cried LOL.
